# NiveshNadi Changelog

## NiveshNadi Phase 1 v442 Batch Changelog Ledger

- Version: `0.442.0`
- Data version: `20260706-v442-01`
- Changes made: Added a durable changelog ledger and static release checks that require each current release entry to include changes, files changed, checks run, and known risks.
- Files changed: `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `app.js`, `docs/BUILD_TRACKER.md`, `index.html`, `package.json`, `release-stamp.txt`, `scripts/static-check.mjs`
- Checks run: `node --check .\app.js`; `npm.cmd run check`; Git diff hygiene check
- Known risks: This release records release evidence only; browser visual QA is still handled as a separate batch verification step before publishing the full five-version batch.
